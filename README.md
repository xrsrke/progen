Paper: [Large language models generate functional protein sequences
across diverse
families](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01618-2)

I am currently working towards this paper. Check out my learning
progress here: https://twitter.com/xariusrke/status/1621403313651728386

### TODO

- Train a tokenizer speciailize for DNA sequence from scratch
- fast2dict
- Extract property of a protein sequence

### Resources

I implemented `ProGen` using these resources
